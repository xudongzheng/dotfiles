I am [Xudong Zheng](https://www.xudongz.com/) and this repository contains my
dotfiles. This isn't meant to be used directly but rather can provide
inspiration for things to include in your own dotfiles.

You will find this particularly helpful if your setup is similar to mine. This
includes:

- Vim for text editing
- Colemak keyboard layout
- Git for version control
- tmux for terminal multiplexing
- Firefox for web browsing
- Thunderbird for email
